# Vue-Assignment

Homepage.html is my main html page.

Note : While giving input for Leaving from and Going to please enter backspace for one or two times and after giving every input please wait for atleast 10/20 seconds because for fetching data it takes some times.  

I have used fetch for autocomplete and flight data inside of vue. For autocomplete i have used basic javascript and vue.js inside a function named autocomplete.


For flight information I have used a function getStories inside of vue.js methods. There I have collected all the necessary data and stored it in json format.

For date i have used jquery date picker.

I have added some animation while fetching flight data from the api. For animation I have used basic javascript, html, and css. The files are named animation.js and animation.css. 

For weather i have used one of rapid apiâ€™s api. From there I can get the current date 24 hours there. From that 24 hours data I have gathered morning, evening, afternoon and night data.
Those codes can be found inside of methods weather function.

For sorting flight information according to price, departing time, and arrival time I have used a basic function using a selector. Those codes can be found inside of methods filter function.
